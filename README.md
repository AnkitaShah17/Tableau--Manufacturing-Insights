Manufacturing Performance Dashboard Using Tableau

In this project, I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize key metrics related to manufacturing performance. The dashboard provides insights into production quantities, rejection rates, and trends over time.

Key Features:

Overall Production Metrics:
Displayed total manufactured quantity (86.77M), processed quantity (86.24M), and rejected quantity (0.52M).

Trend Analysis:
Included line graphs to show day-wise trends for produced and rejected quantities, highlighting fluctuations and patterns over time.

Rejection Analysis:
Utilized bar graphs to analyze manufacturing by rejected quantity across different categories.
Created scatter plots to visualize the percentage of rejected quantities as per FPIP codes.

Interactive Visualizations:
Designed interactive elements to allow users to explore data in detail and gain deeper insights into manufacturing performance.
